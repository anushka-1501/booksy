# booksy
Bookstore "booksy" management system.
Update function in Manage class gives error. When I try adding space between book/ author names it considers the second value as the other cin value. for example code is 
cin>>bname
cin>>aname
I have to enter name as harrypotter or jkrowling so the code works properly or it takes harry as book name and potter as author name if i give input as "harry potter"
I will be adding login function as well.
